# Includes
This directory contains files that need to be included in the built MEKE folder.
I (Michelle) have decided that it is too much of a hassle and too much can go
wrong if we need to separately collect these.

These files are only included in user installs of Python while we are basing
the MEKE off of the embedded install. As such, these were collected from
a python install that had the same version as the embedded one we download
during the build.
